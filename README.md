# Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset

This project applies Logistic Regression on the Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species based on four features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. 

### Files:
- **`notebooks/logistic_regression_iris.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook that includes code for data exploration, model training, and visualization of decision boundaries.
- **`src/logistic_regression.py`**: Python script that contains the main logic for training the model and visualizing decision boundaries.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the dependencies for the project.
- **`iris.csv`**: Optional, the raw Iris dataset (can be downloaded from `https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/`).

### Requirements:
To run the project, make sure to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
